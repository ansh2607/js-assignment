        <h3>Difference between var, let and const: (Examples in js file)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>var declarations are 'globally scoped' 
                or 'function scoped' while let and const 
                are 'block scoped'.</li>
            <li>var and let can be declared without being 
                initialized, while const must be initialized 
                during declaration.</li>
            <li>var variables can be updated and 
                re-declared within its scope; let variables
                can be updated but not re-declared; 
                const variables can neither be updated 
                nor re-declared.</li>
